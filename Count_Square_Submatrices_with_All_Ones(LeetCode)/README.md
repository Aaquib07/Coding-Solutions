# Problem
    Given a m * n matrix of ones and zeros, return how many square submatrices have all ones.

### Constraints
- 1 <= arr.length <= 300
- 1 <= arr[0].length <= 300
- 0 <= arr[i][j] <= 1

# Solution

## Approach
We can make use of dynamic programming as we can use previous information to compute the present situation.
